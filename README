Footprints for pcb , the interactive pcb layout editor (http://pcb.sourceforge.net)

I Added a directory structure to reflect the status of the footprint.

"01_under_construction"
The basic idea is to start with a footprint in this directory.

"02_experimental"
This is a directory for newly born footprints which have not been scrutenised 
for flaws or errors whatsoever.

"03_stable"
This is a directory for footprints used in pcb design, these have been checked 
with pcb it's Design Rule Checking feature.

"04_released"
This is a directory for footprints used in an actually build (prototype) pcbs.
These footprints are tested in a "live" environment.
